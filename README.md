# P01-Shopping-cart
In this assignment, we are going to implement a simple version of a Shopping Cart using Java
Arrays. The Java array is one of several data storage structures that can be used to store and
manage a collection of data. Throughout CS300, we are going to spend a fair amount of time
using arrays and managing collections of data. This relatively simple programming assignment
provides a review of using arrays (perfect size and oversize arrays).
The goals of this assignment include:
• reviewing the use of procedure oriented code (prerequisites for this course),
• practicing the use of control structures, custom static methods, and arrays in methods.
• practicing how to manage a non-ordered collection of data (a bag) which may contain
duplicates (multiple occurrences of the same element),
• learning how to approach an algorithm, and how to develop tests to demonstrate the
functionality of code, and familiarizing yourself with the CS300 grading tests.
the source code can be found in the 'P01 Shopping cart1/src/' directory.
